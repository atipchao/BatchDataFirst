C# Batch console EF-Data First style.

1. Create a Net Standard Consloe C#
2. In your project, RIGHT-CLICK for "Manage NUGET PACKAGE", and be sure to add "EnitityFrameWork" (Standard - not core in my case). 
3. In Your App.Config, be sure that you have Connection string for EF-Datafirst style! 
They aren't the same as EF-EDMX style - see below.

<connectionStrings>    
    <add name="MyContext"
    connectionString="Data Source=YOUR-DATABASE-SERVER;Initial Catalog=DATABASE-NAME;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
    providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
</connectionStrings>


  4. Crete Models folder - as usual just follow the MVC ish pattern.. 
  5. Create your Context class - as usual, see sample.
  6. Create all your of your model classes  -  ones that map to each table in youe database.
  7. Everything else from here on is just like your usual pattern -- read receods fron your input file, read/update tables.. 
  8. just continue on, do what you need...
